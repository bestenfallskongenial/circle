Oka, i tried to create a wire protocol h264 decoder for my oculus  mendax module,
but its really a bare bone single format decoder for

- raw 264 files
- fixed resolution ( 640 to 480 )
- baseline format and level 3.1

it also attempt to create egl picture / gl es 2.0 zero copy textures in an alternating output buffer
