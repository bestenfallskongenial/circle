okay, we will 
1: carry over the log to string functionality from my h264 code 
and than remove the parser log from the project code.
2: we will include the parser for the bpm pictures as well.
   cant imagine right now how to change the project but...
3: we need finally figure out what nal units we need to sen to the vpu in the main render/decoder loop
